# web_scraping_for_python_jobs
I created a simplified version of web scraping in python that takes the lists of python jobs from timesjob.com and after that we can input the skills that we dont want and it saves txt files in a particular folder name posts
Run main.py
All posts from timesjob saves in posts/ folder along with descriptive link
The program runs every 10 minutes until you stop
